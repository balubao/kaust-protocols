# kaust-protocols
I collect all protocols related to managerial tasks in KAUST - such as ibex related configs and such.

1. **Working with R markdown on vscode using conda environments:**

   I report the method in the last comment of the following stack overflow thread:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61540700/how-to-use-jupyter-notebook-with-r-kernel-in-vs-code/78957438#78957438

2. **Connecting to a remote compute node using vs code markdown:**

   I've included the script to describe the overall approach.
